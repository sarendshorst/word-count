# Word Count

This is an application generated by the Eclipse Foundation starter for Jakarta EE.

You can run the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) appropriate for your Jakarta EE version and runtime choice (we have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11 and Java SE 17). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.

```
./mvnw clean package cargo:run
```

After running you can access the following urls.

- [Highest frequency](http://localhost:8080/word-count/rest/word-count/highest-frequency?text=The%20sun%20shines%20over%20the%20lake)
- [Frequency for word](http://localhost:8080/word-count/rest/word-count/frequency-for-word?text=The%20sun%20shines%20over%20the%20lake&word=lake)
- [Most frequent „n‟ words](http://localhost:8080/word-count/rest/word-count/most-frequent-n-words?text=The%20sun%20shines%20over%20the%20lake&n=3)

To run integration tests execute the following command. It will start and stop a local webserver automatically so make sure it is not already running.

```
./mvnw verify
```
